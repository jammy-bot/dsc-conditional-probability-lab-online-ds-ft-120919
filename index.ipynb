    "In order to be ready for real-world applications of probability, it is important to understand what happens when probabilities are not independent. Very often, the probability of a certain event depends on other events happening! Let's see how this all works in this lab.\n",

    "* Use the multiplication rule to find the probability of the intersection of two events\n",
